Updater for Minecraft Dimensions that used a custom Multi Noise Dimension in 1.16 or 1.17 so they can be opened in 1.18.

The actual multi noise definitions are not updated (instead they are reverted to the vanilla overworld preset). You need to use an updated datapack for 1.18 to continue to use a custom layout.
